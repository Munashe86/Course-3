AI Solutions Sub-Account Transfer and Snapshot Creation Policy
AI Solutions' foundational technology is built on the white-label platform, which is utilised by thousands of companies and marketing agencies, including many software resellers. It's important to note that not all resellers operate at the same level.
There is a very small group of agencies that have similarities to AI Solutions, a well-developed and robust company, with dozens of employees, comprehensive policies, and a strong infrastructure to support you and thousands of other customers.
AI Solutions stands out with its extensive team, advanced support systems, and dedication to customer satisfaction. Our departments range from customer service, affiliate sales management team, marketing tech team, customer success, technical support, sales, and infrastructure development, all working together to ensure our clients receive the highest level of service and support. We have invested significantly in training and resources to maintain our high standards.
While the base software may be the same across different agencies, there are significant differences in the level of strategies, guidance, support, and stability provided. We've observed that some agencies are one-person operations, which can leave customers without adequate support.
Our reputation for excellence is further highlighted by the numerous awards we've received from the CEO and executive team of AI Solutions, recognising the large amount of customers we’ve helped.
Additionally, the founders of AI Solutions have played a pivotal role in helping hundreds of AI Solutions agencies start and grow and set the tone as to how an AI Solutions agency is to be run, setting a high standard for others in the industry.
If you are considering transferring out of AI Solutions, please be cautious of resellers who are great at sales but may lack the resources to deliver on their promises and provide reliable support.
At AI Solutions, our commitment to delivering exceptional service and support is unwavering. If there is anything we can do to ensure you remain with us, please reach out to us at info@aisolutions.ky. We will make every effort to meet your needs and support your ongoing partnership with AI Solutions.
Sub-account transfer via Snapshot Creation and Sharing
Within the AI Solutions infrastructure, there are two methods to transfer a sub-account from one agency to another. This policy details AI Solutions's policy for transferring accounts out of our platform. It outlines the procedures and limitations related to sub-account transfers and snapshot creation within the AI Solutions system.
What is a Snapshot? A snapshot in AI Solutions is a template of a sub-account that includes emails, automation, workflows, funnels, websites, opportunities boards, and other essential elements. This functionality was designed to enable agencies like AI Solutions to replicate configurations and assets within their own sub-accounts or share them with other AI Solutions agencies.
AI Solutions's Use of Snapshots
Internal Use: Snapshots are primarily utilised to share configurations within AI Solutions. For instance, if we develop a funnel for hosting webinars, we can share that template across various sub-accounts within AI Solutions.
Intellectual Property Sharing: Snapshots allow us to share our intellectual property, such as automation and workflows, with other AI Solutions agencies that are paid subscribers to AI Solutions’s AI Solutions Sales programs, which are distributed amongst hundreds of AI Solutions agencies, enhancing collaboration and efficiency.
Policy on Snapshot Creation for Transfers
No Snapshots for Transfers Out: AI Solutions does not create snapshots for the purpose of transferring assets out of the AI Solutions ecosystem. The process of transferring snapshots can lead to technical issues, such as broken links, malfunctioning automation, and disrupted workflows, which can compromise the integrity and functionality of the assets being transferred. Furthermore, such transfers can result in security vulnerabilities and data loss, placing an undue burden on both AI Solutions and the receiving party to troubleshoot and resolve these issues.
This policy is strict and will not change under any circumstance, ensuring consistent and reliable service for all customers. AI Solutions is committed to maintaining a high standard of service and safeguarding the intellectual property and operational integrity of all accounts within its ecosystem.
Allowing exceptions to this policy would introduce risks that could undermine the trust and reliability that customers have come to expect from AI Solutions. By upholding this unwavering stance, AI Solutions guarantees that all customers receive uniform and dependable service, free from the disruptions and complications that could arise from policy deviations. This steadfast approach reinforces AI Solutions's dedication to delivering secure, high-quality, and stable solutions to its clientele.
Customer Responsibility: When transitioning from AI Solutions to another platform inside or outside of the AI Solutions infrastructure, sub-account admins and their teams are responsible for recreating all assets, including websites, funnels, automation, and workflows, in the new environment. This practice is consistent with industry standards with other platforms when wanting to move from one platform to another platform.
To assist in this process, here are some steps you can take to make your transfer as simple as possible: Documentation: Begin by thoroughly documenting your existing assets. This includes taking detailed notes on the structure and functionality of your websites, funnels, automation, and workflows. Screenshots, flowcharts, and written descriptions can be extremely helpful.
Export Data: Use any available export features within Account Admin Permissions within AI Solutions to save your data. This might include exporting contact lists and any other data that can be exported manually.
Template Utilization: Look for existing templates in your new platform that might closely match your current setups. Many platforms offer pre-built templates that can save you time and effort.
Step-by-Step Recreation: Recreate your assets step-by-step in the new environment. Start with the most critical elements and build out from there. This methodical approach can help ensure that everything functions correctly.
Seek Support: Take advantage of the support resources available on your new platform. Most platforms offer tutorials, user guides, and customer support services to help you with the transition.
Professional Assistance: Consider hiring a professional or consultant who specialises in the new platform. Their expertise can streamline the transition and help ensure that your new setup is optimised.
Testing: Thoroughly test all recreated assets to ensure they work as intended in the new environment. This includes running through all automation, checking website functionality, and verifying that workflows operate correctly.
Backup: Keep backups of your recreated assets and any important data during the transition period. This provides a safety net in case you need to revert to an earlier version.
Training: Ensure that your team is trained on the new platform. Adequate training can help them adapt quickly and maintain productivity.
Sub-account transfer via Sub-Account Transfer Feature in AI Solutions
AI Solutions has introduced a feature that allows agencies to transfer sub-accounts. This is particularly useful when an agency like AI Solutions acquires another AI Solutions agency and needs to migrate all the sub-accounts from the acquired agency into AI Solutions.
AI Solutions's Sub-Account Transfer Policy
Acquisitions and Mergers: AI Solutions will only perform sub-account transfers in the context of an acquisition or merger. This means that all or an agreed-upon number of sub-accounts will be transferred to AI Solutions when AI Solutions is the acquiring agency. Such transfers will only take place when AI Solutions has reached an agreement with another AI Solutions agency for a full or partial acquisition of their agency, making AI Solutions the receiving agency of the sub-account transfer.
No One-Time Transfers: To ensure the highest level of service and functionality for our customers, AI Solutions does not process one-time sub-account transfer requests out of AI Solutions. The complexity involved in transferring elements such as phone numbers and conversation histories often results in disruptions and potential malfunctions. Although many customers may be willing to take on the risks associated with such transfers, AI Solutions does not offer transfers out of AI Solutions under any circumstances. Therefore, if customers choose to leave AI Solutions, they will need to rebuild all assets in the new agency's environment to maintain optimal performance and service continuity. This policy is in place to protect our customers from the issues that can arise during such complex transfers.
Steps to Transition out of AI Solutions: To assist in your transition, here are some steps you can take to simplify your transfer: Start by thoroughly documenting your existing assets and taking detailed notes on the structure and functionality of your websites, funnels, automation, and workflows. Use screenshots, flowcharts, and written descriptions to capture all important details. Utilise any available export features within Account Admin Permissions in AI Solutions to save your data, including contact lists and any other data that can be manually exported. Look for templates in your new platform that closely match your current setups, as many platforms offer pre-built templates that can save you time and effort during the transition. Recreate your assets step-by-step in the new environment, beginning with the most critical elements and building out from there to ensure everything functions correctly. Utilise the support resources available on your new platform, such as tutorials, user guides, and customer support services, to assist you with the transition. Consider hiring a professional or consultant who specialises in the new platform, as their expertise can streamline the transition and help ensure your new setup is optimised. Thoroughly test all recreated assets to ensure they work as intended in the new environment, running through all automation, checking website functionality, and verifying workflows. Keep backups of your recreated assets and any important data during the transition period to provide a safety net in case you need to revert to an earlier version. Finally, ensure your team is trained on the new platform to help them adapt quickly and maintain productivity.
Commitment to Customer Satisfaction and Retention
At AI Solutions, we are committed to providing exceptional service and support to our customers. However, if transferring out of AI Solutions is the only option for you, we want to express our sincere appreciation for your trust and business during the time we were able to serve you. Your satisfaction and feedback are important to us, and we value the opportunity to have been a part of your success.
If you decide to stay at AI Solutions, we are committed to your continued success and dedicated to ensuring your satisfaction. We are dedicated to delivering exceptional service and support to our customers. If there is anything we can do to have you stay at AI Solutions, please let us know by emailing info@aisolutions.ky, and we will make every effort to accommodate your needs and support your continued partnership with us.
HARDSHIP EXTENSION
In the event that an AI Solutions user who has been on the platform for a minimum of 6 months faces significant hardship, such as unforeseen financial difficulties or personal circumstances, which may prevent them from continuing their AI Solutions subscription, they have the option to request a one-month extension of their subscription period. This extension is intended to provide temporary relief during times of hardship. To be eligible for the hardship extension, the user must have been an AI Solutions customer for at least 6 months. They can request the extension by emailing info@aisolutions.ky explaining their situation and providing relevant supporting documentation. Each request will be reviewed individually by AI Solutions's team, taking into account the user's circumstances, the severity and duration of the hardship, and the user's payment history and engagement with AI Solutions. Granting the one-month extension is at AI Solutions's discretion and not guaranteed. AI Solutions's team will notify the user of their decision via email within a reasonable timeframe, and the decision made will be final and not subject to appeal or dispute. Please note that the courtesy one-month extension can only be granted once per user to maintain fairness and sustainability. This extension does not modify other terms or payment obligations outlined in the AI Solutions terms of service. AI Solutions reserves the right to modify or terminate this hardship extension clause with reasonable notice provided to users. Any changes will be communicated via email to the user's registered email address.

Last Updated: 28 December 2024

AI Business Solutions Ltd. (referred to as “Company,” “us” or “we”) recognizes that your privacy is important.

This Policy discloses the privacy practices for AI Solutions’ website (the “Site”), as well as related products and services we may offer to you (the “Service”).

Please read the information below to learn the following regarding your use of this Site.

We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time.

1. Types of Information We Collect

In order to better provide you with our Service, we collect two types of information about our users: Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) and Aggregate Information.

Personally Identifiable Information: This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. When you engage in certain activities on this Site, such as registering for an account, downloading or purchasing a product or service, submitting content and/or posting content in a public forum on this Site, or sending us feedback, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself.

Examples of PII may include your first and last name, email address, mailing address (including zip code), employer, job title and department, telephone and facsimile numbers, and other identifying information. When ordering products or services on the Site, you may be asked to provide a credit card number.

Aggregate Information: This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain information about you based upon where you visit on our Site and what other sites may have directed you to us. This information, which is collected in a variety of different ways, is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. This information may include the Website’s Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) that points to the site you just came from, which URL you go to after visiting our Site, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address.

2. How We Collect and Use Information

AI Solutions does not collect any PII about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us. However, you may be required to provide certain PII to us when you elect to use certain products or services available on the Site. These may include: (a) registering for an account on our Site; (b) uploading individual transaction data obtained from your third-party invoicing or accounting applications (for example, “QuickBooks,” “Xero,” “Clio” etc.), (c) uploading user generated content and other information uploaded to the Site (d)sending us an email message; (e) submitting a form or transmitting other information by telephone or letter; or (e) submitting your credit card or other payment information when ordering and purchasing products and services on our Site.

We will primarily use your PII to provide product or service offerings to you. We will also use certain forms of PII to enhance the operation of our Site, improve our internal marketing and promotional efforts, statistically analyze Site use, improve our product and service offerings, and customize our Site’s content, layout, and services. We may use certain information about you without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do this for purposes such as analyzing how the Service is used, diagnosing service or technical problems, maintaining security, and personalizing content. We may also use PII to deliver information to you and to contact you regarding administrative notices. Finally, we may use your PII to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our agreements with you, including our Site Terms of Use, and this Privacy Policy.

We may also collect or our third party advertising partners may collect, certain Aggregate Information. For example, we may use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers, software, to administer our Site and to gather demographic information. Our third party advertising partners may also provide us with aggregate, but not individual, reports that will tell us how many ads were presented and clicked upon at our Site.

3. Cookies

Depending on how you use our Site, we will store cookies on your computer in order to collect certain aggregate data about our users and to customize certain aspects of your specific user experience. A cookie is a small data text file which is stored on your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. Cookies may also include more personalized information, such as your IP address, browser type, the server your computer is logged onto, the area code and zip code associated with your server, and your first name to welcome you back to our Site. We may use cookies to perform tasks such as: monitoring aggregate site usage metrics, storing and remembering your passwords (if you allow us to do so), storing account and advertising preferences that you have set, and personalizing the Services we make available to you. However, we do not use cookies to track your browsing behaviors.

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some aspects of the Site may not function properly if you elect to disable cookies.

4. Release of Information

AI Solutions will not sell, trade, or rent your PII to others. We do provide some of our product and service offerings through contractual arrangements made with affiliates, service providers, partners and other third parties (“Service Partners”). We and our Service Partners may need to use some PII in order to perform tasks between our respective sites, or to deliver products or services to you. For example, we must release your credit card information to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment for products and services purchased on this Site; release your address information to the delivery service to deliver products that you ordered; and provide order information to third parties that help us provide customer service.

We will encourage our Service Partners to adopt and promote strong privacy policies. However, the use of your PII by our Service Partners is governed by the respective privacy policies of those providers, and is not subject to our control. Except as otherwise discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. Other Sites accessible through this Site, including our Advertising and Service Partners, have their own privacy policies and data collection, use and disclosure practices. Please consult each Site’s privacy policy. We are not responsible for the policies or practices of third parties.

Occasionally we may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide PII to the appropriate governmental authorities. In such cases, we will disclose PII upon receipt of a court order, subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.

We may also provide Aggregate Information about our customers’ sales, traffic patterns, and related Site information to third party advertisers, but these statistics do not include any Personally Identifiable Information.

5. Updating and Correcting Information

We believe you should have the ability to access and edit the PII that you have provided to us. You may change any of your PII in your account online at any time by linking to your account in accordance with instructions posted elsewhere on this Site.

We encourage you to promptly update your PII if it changes. You may ask to have the information on your account deleted or removed; however, some information, such as past transactions, logs of technical support calls, or other information may not be deleted. In addition, it may be impossible to completely delete your information without some residual information because of backups.

6. User Choices on Collection and Use of Information

We may, from time to time, send you email regarding new products and services that we feel may interest you. In addition, if you indicated upon registration that you are interested in receiving offers or information from us and our partners, we may occasionally call or send you direct mail about products and services that may be of interest to you. Only AI Solutions (or agents working on behalf of AI Solutions and under confidentiality agreements) will send you these solicitations, and only if you have previously indicated that you wish to receive them. If you do not want to receive solicitations from us, you can “opt-out” by accessing your account online editing your account information to no longer receive such offers and mailings.

You also have choices with respect to cookies, as described above. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies some parts of our Site may not work properly in your case.

7. Security of Your PII

At our Site you can be assured that your PII is secure, consistent with current industry standards. We strive to take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of your PII. For example:

• We work hard to ensure that the data we collect is reliable, accurate, complete and current. We encrypt all PII, in order to prevent unauthorized parties from viewing such information when it is transmitted to us. We also only keep collected information: only for as long as reasonably necessary and use it only for the purposes for which it was collected or to comply with any applicable legal or ethical reporting or document retention requirements.

• We limit access to PII only to specific employees, contractors and agents who have a reasonable need to come into contact with your information. For example, we may provide members of our technical support team with limited access to your account in order to allow them to troubleshoot problems you may be having with the Site.

• Additionally, we also employ a number of physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect PII. Our secure servers and our data centers are protected by industry-standard encryption, and our servers reside behind firewalls and employ high-level password protection.

• Finally, access by you to your PII is available through a password and unique customer ID selected by you. This password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone.

In order to most effectively serve you, credit card transactions and order fulfillment are handled by established third party banking institutions and processing agents (such as e.g. PayPal). They receive the information needed to verify and authorize your credit card or other payment information and to process and ship your order.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your PII, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations inherent to the Internet which are beyond our control; and (b) the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this Site cannot be guaranteed. As we have no control or ability to monitor the security of your device, you should take measures reasonably available to secure your device.

In the event that PII is compromised as a result of a breach of security, AI Solutions will promptly notify those persons whose PII has been compromised, in accordance with he notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, by email, or as otherwise required by applicable law. You agree to immediately notify us and your Clients if you have experienced a breach of security on your device which may have affected the security of our Site or Service.

8. Miscellaneous

You must be at least 18 years old to have our permission to use this Site. By agreeing to Our Policy, you are hereby confirming that you are at least of 18 years old. Our policy is that we do not knowingly collect, use or disclose PII about minor visitors.

You should also be aware that when Personally Identifiable Information is voluntarily disclosed (i.e. your name, email address, etc.) in the discussion forums or other public areas on this Site, that information, along with any information disclosed in your communication, can be collected and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages (including unwanted spam messages) from third parties. Such activities are beyond our control and this Policy does not apply to such information. Please consult our Site Terms and Conditions of Use Agreement for our Site Conduct policies.

If you or anyone else have any questions, concerns or inquiries about our Privacy Policy, or our use of your PII, or our privacy practices, please contact us at: info@aisolutions.ky. You can also reach our Privacy Compliance Officer by sending written correspondence to:

AI Solutions Cancellation Policy
Last Updated: 28 December 2024


Welcome to AI Solutions! Our aim is to offer exceptional service and a seamless experience for our users. Below is our comprehensive cancellation policy that outlines the procedures and conditions related to cancelling your AI Solutions subscription.
1.	Cancellation within Initial 30 Days of Purchasing AI Solutions: Customers have the option to cancel their AI Solutions subscription within the initial 30 days of signing up. To initiate cancellation and be eligible for a full refund, please email us at info@aisolutions. Our team will process your request promptly, and the full subscription amount will be refunded to your original payment method.
2.	Cancellation after Initial 30 Days of Purchasing AI Solutions: All payments made after the initial 30 days are considered nonrefundable. We do not provide credits or refunds for partially used subscriptions. However, upon cancellation, access to AI Solutions will continue through the end of the current billing cycle to ensure you have ample time to wrap up any ongoing projects or activities within the platform. We don't offer prorated refunds for unused days if you cancel after the initial 30 days. Our policy grants a full refund only if cancellation occurs within the first 30 days of subscription.
3.	Notice Period and Monthly Payments: Month to Month subscribers have the flexibility to cancel their subscription at any time after the initial 30 days. Your monthly payment is charged on the same day each month, aligned with the start date of your subscription. If you decide to cancel, we request written notice of cancellation at least 30 days before your desired cancellation date. The last month's payment will be charged if the notice is provided within 29 days before the cancellation date. This ensures that your account remains active during this period, allowing continued access to AI Solutions services until the notice period ends.
4.	Cancellation under 12-Month Agreement: In the event of a cancellation under a 12-month agreement, the Customer shall initiate the cancellation process by sending an email notification to info@aisolutions.ky. Upon receipt of the cancellation notification, the Customer shall be required to complete and sign an 'Early Termination Request Form,' which will outline the early termination fees. These fees are equivalent to two months' worth of service charges and are imposed to cover administrative expenses and to facilitate a seamless transition for both parties involved. The early termination fee is calculated by taking the Customer's monthly subscription fee and multiplying it by two. To effectuate the early termination of the agreement, the Customer must duly sign and submit the Early Termination Request Form to the Company. The Customer is obligated to provide a written notice of cancellation at least 30 days in advance of the desired cancellation date. In the event of a cancellation notice received within 29 days prior to cancellation but before 12 months, the early termination fee, along with the subsequent month and any outstanding payments, will be due. All funds paid up until the cancellation date, including the fee, will be forfeited. The cancellation request shall be deemed valid and accepted by the Company once the early termination fee has been paid in full. Following the acceptance of the cancellation request and the payment of the early termination fee, the Customer will retain access to and usage of the platform until the conclusion of the current billing cycle. All communication related to cancellations shall be directed to info@aisolutions.ky.
5.	Data Retention and Account Reactivation: Upon cancellation, users have a 3-day window to reactivate their account without losing any data. After 3 days, all data associated with the account will be permanently deleted from our system. We emphasize that it's the subscriber's responsibility to transfer or remove all media assets, customer lists, configured features (templates, workflows, etc.), funnels, websites, and phone numbers from the service before the cancellation date. Once the data is deleted after the 3-day window following cancellation, it cannot be retrieved. We recommend saving your important data or using the account parking option to retain access to your data.
6.	Refunds, Unused Features, Credits, and Non-Refundable Fees: When you cancel your subscription, please note that certain elements are non-refundable. Unused features, referring to those included in your plan that you haven't utilized, as well as any remaining credits, cannot be refunded. Additionally, fees for telephony usage, text messages (SMS), and emails are non-refundable. We encourage you to make the most of your subscription while it's active. If you decide to cancel, please be aware that refunds, if applicable, apply only to the monthly subscription fee.
7.	Account Parking Option: Subscribers have the option to park their account at a monthly fee of $40/month to save all data within their account. This option is available for up to 6 months. During this period, access will be temporarily removed. Subscribers can't make changes or access data during this time. Reactivation is required to resume full functionality. The data will not be deleted as long as the parking fee is paid. After 6 months, all functions and billing will automatically resume at the original subscription fee. Reactivation before the 6-month period requires sending an email to info@aisolutions.ky, and the account will be reactivated within 3 business days.
8.	Downgrading Subscription: Instead of cancelling, subscribers have the option to downgrade to a lower plan. This allows continued access to AI Solutions at a reduced level of service with limited features for a reduced rate. To proceed with a downgrade, please contact our billing department at info@aisolutions.ky. Our team will assist you in selecting an appropriate plan that suits your requirements.
9.	Cancellation Notification and Confirmation: When initiating a cancellation request by emailing info@aisolutions.ky, our team will promptly acknowledge receipt within 1-2 business days, confirming that your cancellation request is in process. Refunds for cancellations within the initial 30 days will be processed typically within 7-14 business days after confirmation of the cancellation. Upon successful cancellation, you will receive a confirmation email with the cancellation date, ensuring you won't be billed for any subsequent periods.
10.	Termination by the Company: AI Solutions reserves the right to terminate a user's subscription or access to the service in cases of violation of our terms of service or misuse of the platform. Users will be notified in such cases, and termination will be in accordance with our terms of service.

SECTION 3. COMPENSATION
Upon acceptance into the Program, You will receive a unique Affiliate ID through https://AI Solutions.firstpromoter.ky. This Affiliate ID will be incorporated in the URL that You use to advertise AI Solutions. You may earn Commissions (as further described below) for each sale (“Sale”) that is registered using Your Affiliate ID.
In the event that a Prospect has multiple Affiliate cookies (“Cookies”), the most recently acquired Cookie will generally determine which Affiliate is credited with a Sale except in instances of (i) recently cancelled Prospects who attempt to re-subscribe under a different affiliate within 90 days of cancellation, (ii) cases of self-referral, or (iii) other scenarios at AI Solutions’ sole discretion. If a Prospect signs up for AI Solutions without connection to any Affiliate, that Prospect is considered unaffiliated, and no Commissions will be earned by any Affiliates for that Prospect unless otherwise agreed to by AI Solutions in writing.
A Commission is “earned” only if (i) Affiliate has registered and maintained a usable account with a third-party payment provider to receive Commission payments and provided complete and accurate information to AI Solutions to facilitate payment and (ii) a Prospect’s account has remained in good status for at least forty-five (45) days after the Sale. No Commission is earned for a Sale if, at the time of attempted payout, Affiliate has not maintained a usable account with a third-party payment provider or AI Solutions is unable to payout Commissions due to incomplete or inaccurate information provided by the Affiliate. Commission payout amounts will be determined by AI Solutions in its sole discretion. Commission rates may change from time to time at AI Solutions’ sole discretion. Except as otherwise provided herein, Commission payouts will be paid on the 15th of each month following AI Solutions' receipt of payment for a Sale, subject to the other terms of this Agreement. In the event the 15th of each month falls on a holiday or weekend, Commission payouts will typically occur on the following business day, although exceptions may apply. All Commission payouts are calculated based on the amount of fees received by AI Solutions, less sales taxes.
The Commission Rates are as follows:
a. Single Account: 30% (applicable to all AI Solutions Users)
b. Single Account: 50% (applicable to only AI Solutions 50/50 Affiliates that register on AI Solutions.com/5050)
In instances where a Prospect is affiliated under different Affiliates for different services (such as cases where one Affiliate makes the Sale, but another affiliate makes an upgrade for the same Prospect), AI Solutions will allocate Commissions as deemed appropriate in AI Solutions’s sole and absolute discretion.
All Commissions are paid in U.S. Dollars (USD) or otherwise in currencies offered by the payment provider. Some payment methods may incur processing fees that may be deducted from Your Commissions. Your combined Commission must be equal to or exceed Fifty and 00/100 Dollars ($50.00) (USD) before You receive a payment from AI Solutions. If Your combined Commissions in a 120-day period do not exceed $50.00 (USD), Your Commissions will not be paid and will be forfeited.
Affiliates must register with a third party payment provider to receive Commissions payouts. AI Solutions or the third party payment provider may require You to submit a completed W-8 or W-9 tax form or any ancillary supporting documentation or tax other documents (the “Required Documents”) before processing Commissions payouts. If You fail to submit the Required Documents in a timely manner, AI Solutions or the third party payment provider may refuse to payout Commissions that were earned more than 120 days prior to receiving your Required Documents.  If You are not a resident of the United States, AI Solutions may withhold tax (including, not limited to, VAT) where required by applicable law. You are solely responsible for complying with all tax laws in Your respective jurisdiction(s) including, but not limited to, the payment of all required taxes, and filing of all returns and other required documents with, the applicable governing body(ies).
If AI Solutions determines, in its sole and exclusive discretion, that any Sale was procured fraudulently or as a result of any violation of this Agreement or applicable law, no Commission will be considered earned for such Sale. If a Commission has already been paid out for a Sale that is later deemed by AI Solutions to be fraudulent or in violation of this Agreement or the law, the Commission amount will automatically be withheld against any future Commissions or refunded back to AI Solutions at its option. AI Solutions may also terminate this Agreement and Your participation in the Program immediately without any further liability to you.
If a refund or charge-back occurs for a Sale, and if a Commission was already paid to You for that Sale, such Commission is considered unearned, and the Commission will be deducted from Your future Commission payouts.
AI Solutions will make reasonable efforts to payout all Earned Commissions. In the event that AI Solutions is unable to payout a Commission for any reason outside of AI Solutions’ control, those Commissions may be forfeited at AI Solutions’ sole discretion.
SECTION 4. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
AI Solutions may provide you with certain resources and materials (such as courses, powerpoints, pitch decks, website templates, images, social media posts, etc) to be used in connection with your participation in the Program (collectively, “AI Solutions Materials”).

In such an instance, and in our sole discretion, we may also for the aforementioned reasons, terminate our relationship and suspend any accounts owned/controlled by You. In the event this Agreement is terminated due to Your default, You immediately forfeit all Commissions, and any other payments owed to You or that may in the future be owed to You without any further liability by AI Solutions to You.

SECTION 11. DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION, CLASS ACTION WAIVER, & GOVERNING LAW
Any dispute arising hereunder shall be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association pursuant to its then-current rules. The arbitration shall be conducted before a panel of one arbitrator in Dallas County, Texas. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language. The arbitrators will be bound to apply the laws of the State of Texas. The decision of the arbitrator(s) will be made in writing and shall be final and binding on the parties. Each party shall be responsible for its own costs with respect to the proceedings irrespective of the outcome.

Furthermore, the parties agree not to bring any disputes between each other on a collective or class basis; rather, the parties agree to bring such disputes in arbitration on an individual basis only. An arbitrator may not resolve any disputes concerning the enforceability or validity of this class and collective action waiver; only a court with proper jurisdiction may resolve such a dispute.
